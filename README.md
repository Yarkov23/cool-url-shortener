2. What If part

To adapt our URL shortener for a large-scale scenario, the primary mechanism we'd introduce is a distributed architecture. This involves setting up multiple nodes, possibly in various geographic locations, to handle incoming requests. Load balancers would direct traffic, ensuring efficient request handling and failover mechanisms. By using Redis, we can manage hot URLs in memory to provide instant access. Coupled with consistent hashing, this ensures each request is routed to the correct node even if there are additions or removals from our node pool.

MongoDB, due to its inherent sharding capability, would be our primary data store. Its distributed nature allows it to handle vast amounts of data efficiently while ensuring high availability. On top of these, a periodic cleanup mechanism would be crucial: aging URLs or those with short lifespans can be archived or deleted, maintaining system efficiency and relevancy of the dataset.
