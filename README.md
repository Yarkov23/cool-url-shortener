2. What If part

To adapt our URL shortener for a large-scale scenario, the primary mechanism we'd introduce is a distributed architecture. This involves setting up multiple nodes, possibly in various geographic locations, to handle incoming requests. Load balancers would direct traffic, ensuring efficient request handling and failover mechanisms. We can use Redis for url that will be accessed a lot of times in some period of time. MongoDB, due to its inherent sharding capability, would be our primary data store. We also need to use a good url shortener algorithm to avoid collisions. On top of these, a periodic cleanup mechanism would be crucial: aging URLs or those with short lifespans can be archived or deleted, maintaining system efficiency and relevancy of the dataset.
